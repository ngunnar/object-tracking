    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual Tracking = Process to detecting the position of an object in each frame of video.\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimum Output Sum of Squared Error (MOSSE) = a form of Optimized Correlation Output Filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main components of the algoritm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual tracking is difficult due to variation in the appearance of an object and its surroundings in a video. Object appearance changes due to pose, lighting, natural variations or non ridid transformation. Object may be occluded or move out of the frame of the video.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition of terms\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Object/Target**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    An object is thing which has definable characteristics. An object can also referred as a target\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Template**\n",
    "\n",
    "    A sub-image cropped form a larger image. The template is used as an input to initialize the filter. An image of an object is present in the template.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Correlation**\n",
    "\n",
    "    A measure of similarity between two images. The template is moved to different locations in the image and the posistion of the best match is the one with highest correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Filter**\n",
    "\n",
    "    A sub-image placed over the image at different locations and computing pairwise-sum of the filter and corresponding image pixels. When the filter is applied across an entire image the result is itself a new image, i.e. a filtered image.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tracking window**\n",
    "\n",
    "    A sub-image in which the tracker looks for the new lokcation of the object. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Synthetic target**\n",
    "\n",
    "    A synthetically genereted image with a Gaussian peak at the location if the object to be tracked. Used to map the input image to its corresponding output to generate a filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Occlusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Caused by an object which blocks the view of another object in th video.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tracking**\n",
    "\n",
    "    An action where the algotithm finds the new location of an object in all the frames of a video over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Initialization**\n",
    "\n",
    "    A process where the filter used for tracking an object in a video is generated. Can also be referred to as training.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Updating**\n",
    "\n",
    "    A process where a filter is updated with the new information about the object, for example chage in the pose of a person or change in the scale of an object is a new information.\n"
